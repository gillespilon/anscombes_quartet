# Anscombe's quartet

## In brevi

Francis Anscombe created four data sets in 1973 to demonstrate the value of graphical analysis before statistical analysis. Each set of 11 x-y pairs has nearly identical descriptive statistics and different graphical analyses.

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate a scatter plot with a linear regression line, four scatter plots in a grid, and descriptive statistics.

## Data

anscombes_quartet_1. The data form a linear relationship with variation around the regression line.

anscombes_quartet_2. The data form a curved relationship.

anscombes_quartet_3. The data form a linear relationship with very little variation around the regression line, and one severe outlier.

anscombes_quartet_4. The data form a vertical relationship and one extreme outlier.
